The `custom_types.go` file in the directory structure you provided serves a critical role in defining the custom resource for a Kubernetes application. This is often part of the controller design pattern used in Kubernetes development, where the controller manages the state of custom resources. Let’s delve into the purpose of this file, explaining each part of the code, its logic, and its interdependencies with `main.go` and `custom_controller.go`.

### Purpose of `custom_types.go`

1. **Define Custom Resource Types**: The file defines the data structures that represent the desired and observed states of a custom Kubernetes resource (in this case, a `CustomApp`).
2. **Support Deep Copying**: It provides methods to create deep copies of the resource objects, which is essential for safely manipulating these objects within Kubernetes’ controller logic.
3. **Group and Versioning**: It defines the API group and version for the custom resource, enabling Kubernetes to manage it appropriately.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Line

```go
package v1
```
- This line declares the package name. By convention, it indicates that this is version 1 of the API.

```go
import (
        metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
        "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
        "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/schema"
)
```
- The `import` statement brings in necessary packages:
  - `metav1`: Provides types for metadata common in Kubernetes objects (like `TypeMeta` and `ObjectMeta`).
  - `runtime`: Provides runtime types used in Kubernetes.
  - `schema`: Helps in defining the API group and version.

### Custom Resource Specification and Status

```go
// desired state of Custom App
type CustomAppSpec struct {
        Replicas int32  `json:"replicas"`
        Image    string `json:"image"`
}
```
- **CustomAppSpec**: This struct defines the desired state of the `CustomApp`. It has:
  - `Replicas`: The number of replicas desired.
  - `Image`: The container image to use.

```go
// observed state of CustomApp
type CustomAppStatus struct {
        AvailableReplicas int32 `json:"availableReplicas"`
}
```
- **CustomAppStatus**: This struct represents the observed state of the `CustomApp`, specifically the number of replicas that are currently available.

### Main Resource Definition

```go
type CustomApp struct {
        metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
        metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

        Spec   CustomAppSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
        Status CustomAppStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
```
- **CustomApp**: This struct encapsulates the complete custom resource:
  - `TypeMeta`: Includes the type information (like kind and API version).
  - `ObjectMeta`: Holds standard metadata (like name, namespace).
  - `Spec`: Contains the desired state of the application.
  - `Status`: Contains the observed state.

### Deep Copy Methods

```go
func (in *CustomApp) DeepCopyInto(out *CustomApp) {
        *out = *in
        in.ObjectMeta.DeepCopyInto(&out.ObjectMeta)
}
```
- **DeepCopyInto**: This method allows for creating a deep copy of the `CustomApp` object. It ensures that the copied object contains distinct instances of the nested structures.

```go
func (in *CustomApp) DeepCopyObject() runtime.Object {
        if in == nil {
                return nil
        }
        out := new(CustomApp)
        in.DeepCopyInto(out)
        return out
}
```
- **DeepCopyObject**: This method is a wrapper that returns a deep copy of the object as a `runtime.Object`. It ensures that if `in` is nil, it doesn’t panic.

### Custom Resource List

```go
// CustomAppList
type CustomAppList struct {
        metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
        metav1.ListMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
        Items           []CustomApp `json:"items"`
}
```
- **CustomAppList**: This struct is used to represent a list of `CustomApp` resources. It contains:
  - `TypeMeta` and `ListMeta`: For metadata about the list itself.
  - `Items`: An array of `CustomApp` items.

### List Deep Copy Methods

```go
func (in *CustomAppList) DeepCopyInto(out *CustomAppList) {
        *out = *in
        in.ListMeta.DeepCopyInto(&out.ListMeta)
        out.Items = make([]CustomApp, len(in.Items))
        for i := range in.Items {
                in.Items[i].DeepCopyInto(&out.Items[i])
        }
}
```
- **DeepCopyInto for CustomAppList**: Similar to the previous deep copy function, it ensures all items in the list are also deeply copied.

```go
func (in *CustomAppList) DeepCopyObject() runtime.Object {
        if in == nil {
                return nil
        }
        out := new(CustomAppList)
        in.DeepCopyInto(out)
        return out
}
```
- **DeepCopyObject for CustomAppList**: Creates a deep copy of the list and returns it as a `runtime.Object`.

### Group Version Declaration

```go
var (
        GroupVersion = schema.GroupVersion{Group: "webapp.com", Version: "v1"}
)
```
- **GroupVersion**: Defines the API group and version for this custom resource. This is important for Kubernetes to recognize and manage different types of resources.

### Relationship between Files

- **Dependency Relationship**:
  - `custom_types.go` is foundational because it defines the custom resource types used by both `main.go` and `custom_controller.go`.
  - `main.go` likely initializes the controller and sets up the necessary configurations for it to function, which would require definitions from `custom_types.go`.
  - `custom_controller.go` would implement the business logic to handle the lifecycle of `CustomApp`, relying on the types and methods defined in `custom_types.go`.

### Creation Order of Files

1. **`custom_types.go`**: This should be created first to define the data structures.
2. **`custom_controller.go`**: Next, implement the controller logic, which will utilize the types defined in `custom_types.go`.
3. **`main.go`**: Finally, write the main entry point of the application, which sets up and runs the controller. 

This order ensures that when you are implementing the controller and the main application logic, the necessary types are already defined and available for use.
